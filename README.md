**Project Overview**

This project revolves around developing an autonomous robotic solution in C language using the VEX platform. The focus is on programming a scaled-down robotic forklift to autonomously navigate a warehouse environment, accurately pick up a payload, and return to a designated area, the functionality and efficiency for which I was tested for in person.

**In this robot navigation control project:**

- I developed the ability to write functions that precisely control the movement of a VEX robot using closed-loop control techniques, implementing and tuning Proportional (P) and Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers for various robot operation function for each movement types.
- integrated and utilized sensor data to guide the robot's navigation, including line following and sonar-based obstacle detection.
- accounted for the physical limitations of the robot and closed-loop control systems in a real-world scenario, e.g the power of both wheels were not exactly identical, so I had to implement a closed-loop control system for continuous correction for the differences in each wheel's distance travelled.

In writing the code solutions for the robot, we also had to design and draw complete flowcharts that accurately describes the logic and sequence of the programming solutions.
